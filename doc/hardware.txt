## Monoprice PTZ Camera 39512

Monoprice [camera 39512](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=39512) with

* [Video System Control Architecture, a.k.a. VISCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VISCA_Protocol)
- controlled Pan/Tilt/Zoom;
* 1080p resolution;
* USB3 connection to computer carrying both Video stream and VISCA signals;
* VISCA serial socket present

Pleasant surprise: the USB3 interface includes a built-in USB->UART chip,
so a single USB3 cable is used for both VISCA control and video streaming.

## Installation on Linux

No to braille display:
```sh
sudo apt remove brltty
```

Connect your USB camera - this may result in /dev/ttyUSB* being created!
Mine did just that!

Connect USB->serial converter, then check kernel messages for possible errors:
```sh
journalctl -b | tail -40
```

A device should have been created:
```sh
ls -la /dev/ttyUSB*
```

Expose it to all:
```sh
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0
```
